# Landingpage project
This project is originaly for freecodecamp chanlenge. But i made it for my friend, so she can use it as a web presentation of herself.
This web was made with a litle help of skeleton framework (for responsivenes) and also with help od Travesy Media YT channel. I took some inspiration with the navbar from the video.
